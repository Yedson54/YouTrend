# Web Application with Dash

## Overview

This web application built with Dash serves multiple purposes, catering to both users interested in obtaining statistics about trending YouTube videos and content creators. Below is a breakdown of the app's structure:

### 1. Main Page

In the "Main" page, users can explore the current ranking of the most popular videos based on the data collected at the moment. This section provides a real-time snapshot of the trending videos on YouTube.

### 2. Descriptive Statistics Page

The "Descriptive Statistics" page offers additional insights into the characteristics of trending videos. Users can access statistics related to themes, creators, and other relevant information. This section provides a more in-depth analysis to understand trends and patterns.

### 3. Duration Model Page

On the "Duration Model" page, users can leverage a predictive model to analyze the probability of a YouTube video reaching the trending section. The model considers various features such as video length, creator's subscriber count, and publication date to calculate the survival probability of a video.

### 4. Diffusion Model Page

The "Diffusion Model" page is designed for video creators. It enables them to generate thumbnails for their videos based on a text input, such as the video title. To access this feature, users need to provide a token generated on the Hugging Face website. The application provides a convenient way for creators to enhance their video presentation.
